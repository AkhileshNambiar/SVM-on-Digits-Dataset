# SVM-on-Digits-Dataset
This project focuses on applying Support Vector Machines (SVM) to the Digits dataset. The Digits dataset is a classic machine learning dataset used for handwritten digit recognition, where the goal is to classify images of digits (0-9) into their respective categories.

Key components of the project include:

Data Import and Exploration:

The dataset is loaded using sklearn.datasets.load_digits.
Exploratory analysis may involve visualizing sample images and understanding the dataset's structure.

Preprocessing:

Preparing the dataset for training and testing by splitting it using train_test_split.

Modeling:

Implementing SVM classification using sklearn.svm.SVC.

Evaluation:

Analyzing the model's performance using appropriate metrics, possibly including accuracy, precision, recall, or confusion matrices.
